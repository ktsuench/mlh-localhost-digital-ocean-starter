## Technologies used in this project

## NodeJS

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. NodeJS was the platform in which we built this application.

### NPM packages used

#### [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node. This is the framework with which we built the application.
